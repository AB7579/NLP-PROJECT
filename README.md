Sentiment Analysis with Gradio
This is a simple sentiment analysis project that uses Gradio to create a web interface for a sentiment analysis model. The model is trained on a dataset of movie reviews and predicts whether the sentiment of the review is positive, negative, or neutral.

Installation
To run this project, you will need to have Python 3 installed on your computer. You can download Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

Once you have Python installed, you can clone this repository using Git:

b
git clone https://github.com/your-username/sentiment-analysis-gradio.git

After cloning the repository, navigate to the project directory and install the required packages using pip:


cd sentiment-analysis-gradio
pip install -r requirements.txt


Usage
To run the Gradio interface, simply run the NLPFINAL-sentiment-analyzer.py script:

Copy code
python NLPFINAL-sentiment-analyzer.py
This will start the Gradio server and open the interface in your default web browser. You can enter any text into the textbox and the model will predict the sentiment of the text.

Customization
If you want to customize the sentiment analysis model or the Gradio interface, you can modify the train.py and NLPFINAL-sentiment-analyzer.py scripts respectively.

The train.py script contains the code for training the sentiment analysis model. You can modify this code to use a different dataset, change the model architecture, or adjust the hyperparameters.

The NLPFINAL-sentiment-analyzer.py script contains the code for creating the Gradio interface. You can modify this code to change the input and output types, adjust the styling of the interface, or add additional functionality.
